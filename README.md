**Why:**
I want to familiarize myself with Java a lot more when it comes to game development work. I've always felt a disconnect between Java and C++ when it came to my career and only used it
for software development or random assignments. This personal project is to help me with that connection. I understand that those languages are widely used in the industry. I eventually want to feel like coding in these languages is just like me writing an essay and not writing a Spanish composition.

**Current:**
This is a work in progress. I have an outline of what I want to do in my journal. This idea originally was for my final Java assignment but the class didn't end up doing it. So I've decided to have some fun with it and not nitpick. Since this is an early version of what I have, it will look super sloppy. If you are a hiring manager, please note that my code normally looks a lot nicer and more comprehensible :)

**Future:**
I will be fleshing out the Ability class and adding the following classes:
Body 
Hair
Accessories
Clothes
Shoes
Weaponry

There isn't a particular order in which I will add these, but I would like to also add an IO file into this so that the player's character gets saved throughout the entire program.
